# Python GitHub Template

![Python CI](https://github.com/aghakishiyeva/ids706-mini-project-1/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This is a basic Python template with CI setup using GitHub Actions. It also provides a **.devcontainer** setup for seamless development inside a Docker container with Visual Studio Code..

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Local Development with VS Code and .devcontainer
1. Ensure you have **Docker** installed and running on your machine.
2. Install the **Remote - Containers** extension in VS Code.
3. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
4. Open the repository in VS Code.
5. A notification will pop up suggesting you reopen the project in a container. Click on "Reopen in Container". (Alternatively, you can press **F1**, type "Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container", and press Enter.)
6. The first time you do this, Docker will build an image based on the provided **Dockerfile**. This may take a few minutes.
7. Once inside the container, you'll have a ready-to-use Python environment, isolated from your local system.

### üß™ Running Tests

To run tests in this project, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This command runs all the unit tests and ensures that any changes made haven't introduced new issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è File Structure
* src/main.py: Contains the primary function greet which returns a greeting message.
* tests/test_main.py: Holds unit tests for the greet function.
* requirements.txt: Specifies the Python dependencies required for this project.
* .devcontainer: Configurations for the VS Code remote container development environment.
* .github/workflows/main.yml: Workflow definitions for Continuous Integration using GitHub Actions.
